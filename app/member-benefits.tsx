                    In addition to fighting major label/distribution streaming 
                    income diversion away from Independent sound recording owners
                     in the form of “breakage”, A2IM works to guarantee that our 
                     members are receiving equitable treatment in licensing deal 
                     structures. We work with important partners such as YouTube,

                     meetings between our members and key personnel at these

                    A2IM also works closely with SoundExchange to establish 
                    solutions addressing data and claims issues, including 
                    ensuring that royalty payouts are fairly attributed 
                    to the rightful owners. Our efforts include our 
                    presence on the SoundExchange Board and committees, 
                    data cleansing, more transparent search and claiming 
                    system, member education on SoundExchange programs, 
                    DMCA Notice/enforcement assistance, and proper 
                    attribution in repertoire disputes between Indies 
                    and majors. In 2014, A2IM also secured a sizable 
                    pro rata rebate of over $600,000, “the Advocacy 
                    adjustment,” from major labels on behalf of Independent labels.
